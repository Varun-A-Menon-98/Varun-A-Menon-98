Investors should focus on Manhattan for higher returns due to its popularity and premium pricing, while Brooklyn offers strong demand and lower prices, making it an attractive market. With limited availability in Brooklyn, competitive pricing or upgraded property features can attract tenants. Entire House/Apartment listings are preferred for privacy, though budget-conscious travelers may seek shared rooms, especially in Manhattan and Brooklyn. Align pricing strategies to target market preferences, and consider partnering with reputable hosts like Sonder to boost credibility. Prioritizing high-quality private rooms with top-notch amenities can enhance guest satisfaction and drive positive reviews.|
